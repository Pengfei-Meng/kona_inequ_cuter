# kona_inequ_cuter
Playground for Kona inequality constraints with homotopy continuation method, testing on Cuter
To use the Kona Cuter interface, one need first to download the CUTEr SIFDecode and SIF tarballs from the website to the linux system. Then install CUTEr and SIFDEC following the each's readme file. Meanwhile, 'cutermgr.py' also has instructions on environmental settings for installing CUTEr and SIFDEC, so one can reference instructions from two sides.
